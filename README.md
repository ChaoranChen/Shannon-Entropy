# Shannon-Entropy-week2

#### optimal_estimation_of_the_differential_entropy

## Work plan for week2    

1. Find the relation between Shannon entropy and differential entropy.    
2. Proof the equation: h(f) = H(f) + ln(h).            
3. Based on JVHW entropy estimator, find the most proper integral interval h.
